# Webcubator
> The Innovation Nexus for Startups

This project is a PoC (made in 12 hours!) for Aspire's Startup Spring. It does not have any functional value beside basic OAuth login with LinkedIn and a scrappy listing page with AI generated startups.

## Getting started

To install dependencies run:

```
npm install
```

Then, fill out the required variables in your `.env` file (make a copy after `.env.example`).

To run the development server run:

```
npm run dev
```
